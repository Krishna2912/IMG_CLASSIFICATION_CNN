# IMG_CLASSIFICATION_CNN

In this work, i have used tensorflow keras ImageDataGenerator to built this CNN.
all data labeling done with use of ImageDataGenerator
convolution layer with maxpool and dense layers is used for building up the model

To test the model which i have trained.
I used the sample images that composed of black and white images.
